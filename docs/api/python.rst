utility
~~~~~~~

This submodule contains useful utility functions like parsing meshes
or checking if the polyhedron's mesh plane unit normals point outwards
like it is required by the polyhedral-gravity model.

.. py:function:: read(input_files)
    :noindex:

    Reads a polyhedron from a mesh file. The vertices and faces are read from input
    files (either .node/.face, mesh, .ply, .off, .stl). File-Order matters in case of the first option!

    :param List[str] input_files: polyhedral source files
    :return: tuple of vertices (N, 3) (floats) and faces (N, 3) (ints)
    :rtype: Tuple[List[List[float[3]]], List[List[int[3]]]]

.. py:function:: check_mesh(vertices, faces)
    :noindex:

    Checks if no triangles of the polyhedral mesh are degenerated by checking that their surface area
    is greater zero.
    Further, Checks if all the polyhedron's plane unit normals are pointing outwards.
    Reads a polyhedron from a mesh file

    :param List[List[float[3]]] vertices: vertices of the polyhedron
    :param List[List[int[3]]] faces: faces of the polyhedron
    :return: True if no triangle is degenerated and the polyhedrons plane unit normals are all pointing outwards.
    :rtype: Bool

.. py:function:: check_mesh(input_files)
    :noindex:

    Checks if no triangles of the polyhedral mesh are degenerated by checking that their surface area
    is greater zero.
